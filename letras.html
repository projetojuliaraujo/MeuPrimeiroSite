        <p></p>I've got fire for a heart
        <p></p>I'm not scared of the dark
        <p></p>You've never seen it look so easy
        <p></p>I got a river for a soul
        <p></p>And baby, you're a boat
        Baby, you're my only reason
        <br>
        If I didn't have you, there would be nothing left
        The shell of a man that could never be his best
        If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun
        You taught me how to be someone, yeah
        <br>
        All my life, you stood by me
        When no one else was ever behind me
        All these lights, they can't blind me
        With your love, nobody can drag me down
        All my life, you stood by me
        When no one else was ever behind me
        All these lights, they can't blind me
        With your love, nobody can drag me down
        <br>
        Nobody, nobody
        Nobody can drag me down
        Nobody, nobody
        Nobody can drag me down
